Hi there, I'm Liang Yu-Hao (梁羽皓) 👋
🚀 A Master's Student Passionate about AOI, Computer Vision, and Mechatronics.

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology (NKUST). My research focuses on Automated Optical Inspection (AOI), Visual Servoing, and Mechatronics Integration. I specialize in building hybrid software architectures (C++/C#) to bridge high-performance algorithms with user-friendly interfaces for industrial applications.
我目前就讀於國立高雄科技大學電機工程系碩士班，專注於自動光學檢測 (AOI)、視覺伺服控制與機電整合 領域。擅長設計 C++/C# 混合語言架構，致力於將高效能演算法與使用者介面完美整合，解決工業自動化中的實際難題。
